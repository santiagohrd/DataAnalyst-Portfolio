# About
Hey, welcome to my GitHub Data Analyst Portfolio!

My name is Santiago Herrera and I'm passionate about solving problems and thrilled when I get to assist others in the process. I'll show you a selection of data analytics projects I've completed, highlighting my understanding of the fundamentals of the field, my flexibility to adapt, and an attitude focused on growth and finding solutions.

In this repository, you will come across several folders and sub-folders that contain projects that demonstrate skills to solve some business problems. Furthermore, I showcase my programming progress in SQL, demonstrating my ability to distill valuable insights from expansive datasets.

I am currently studying at Brigham Young-Idaho University for a bachelor's degree in Applied Technology where I have seen a variety of courses focused on SQL, and other courses to keep strengthening knowledge and constant practice.

In addition to this, the skills acquired from working as a Real-Time Analyst have allowed me to continue improving SQL, Excel, and critical thinking in problem-solving skills.
